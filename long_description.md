This particular photo-masking application is about a round stone mortar with two
holes on both sides. The object was found in Gird-i Bazar, which is part of a
Neo-Assyrian settlement complex (ca. 900-600 BCE) located in the Kurdish
Autonomous Region of Iraq, province of Sulaymaniyah. The mortar was
excavated in the summer of 2016 during archaeological investigations carried
out by LMU Munich's Ancient History Department, which has been running the
excavation since 2015.
Stonemortars were, and sometimes still are, used with stone pestles to prepare
ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or
powder. With this crowd-sourcing project we are asking for your help to assist
with the 3D documentation of one of these tools.
